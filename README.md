This is an unofficial repo is to build [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
with glibc and jemalloc support.

This repo is for building unofficial Docker images (mainly ARMv8) **for my own use**.
Please use the official binary from Prometheus.

The Dockerfile takes the inspiration from [Ricard Bejarano](https://github.com/ricardbejarano/prometheus/).
