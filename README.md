This is an unofficial repo is to build [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) with glibc and jemalloc support.

**I used two AI two review the settings, both AI said jemalloc would not be used.**
**So I would stop updating this repo.**

This repo is for building unofficial Docker images (mainly ARMv8) **for my own use**.
Please use the official binary from Prometheus.

The Dockerfile takes the inspiration from [Ricard Bejarano](https://github.com/ricardbejarano/prometheus/).
